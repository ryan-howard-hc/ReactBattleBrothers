# Define game entities and data structures
Initialize game grid
Create player's squad
Create enemy units
Create game state variables (e.g., current player, game over status)

## Define terrain and elevation attributes
const TerrainType = {
  OPEN: 'open',
  ROCKS: 'rocks',
  TREES: 'trees',
  MARSH: 'marsh',
};

class Hexagon {
  constructor(terrain, elevation) {
    this.terrain = terrain;
    this.elevation = elevation;
  }
}

# Main game loop
while game is not over:
## Process player's turn
    if current player is the player:
        Display game grid
        Allow player to select units and perform actions
        Update game state based on player's actions
        Check for win/lose conditions

## Process enemy turn
    else:
        Execute AI for enemy units (e.g., move towards player, attack)
        Update game state based on enemy actions

## Toggle player turns
    Toggle current player

# Handle game over
Display game over message (victory/defeat)

# Actions and AI
function player_select_unit():
    Allow the player to click on a unit on the grid

function player_move_unit(selected_unit, destination_hex):
    Calculate path to destination_hex
    Check if path is valid (e.g., no obstacles)
    Move the unit to the destination_hex

function player_attack_unit(attacking_unit, target_unit):
    Calculate damage, defense, and other combat mechanics
    Apply damage to the target unit
    Check if the target unit is defeated

function enemy_ai(unit):
    Implement simple AI logic (e.g., move towards the nearest player unit, attack if in range)

# Game initialization
function initialize_game():
    Create a hexagonal grid
    Place player's units on the grid
    Place enemy units on the grid
    Initialize game state variables

# Check win/lose conditions
function check_game_over():
    if all player units are defeated:
        Set game over, enemy wins
    if all enemy units are defeated:
        Set game over, player wins
